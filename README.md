# Coding Problem Sets

I solve various problems from interview problems to data structures problems

I do this to help me master the basics of programming and further my skillset

These are done in various languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Swift

If a problem is done in one language, you can bet it is done in the others

*Note that Swift is a few problems behind*

## Repository Structure

Directories begin with the language used to program in

Inside these directories lie sub-directories with difficulty levels

Each file is named after the problem I am tackling

## File Strucuture

For each problem, I create a brute force method and an optimal method

The brute force method helps me understand how the problem is solved but leads to runtime complexities such as O(n^2)

The optimal method helps me change my perspective of problem solving and leads to better runtime complexities. Sometimes they are sub O(n)

Each problem is loaded with comments to explain my thought process and what the program is doing

At the end is either the main function or the code that will execute to call the functions and print out their values

*Thanks to LeetCode for the plethora of problems*
